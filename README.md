# Usability Planner

A tool created to make easier the integration of Usability and User-centred design techniques into software engineering processes depending on the constraints given by the project. Mostly oriented to developers with few or none skills about User Experience and design.

The project was developed while I was participating as an intern in the Software Engineering Laboratory (Technical University of Madrid).
