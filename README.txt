1. 'assets' is the folder which contain the shared code (CSS, JS, XML data files, XSL templates and PHP scripts to up/download plan files)

2. 'activities' and 'stages' are folders which contain both app versions. Each version consists basically on an index.php script and a single js file with constants

    If you want to make changes o create a new version:
	2.1 Make a copy of these both files on a different folder
	2.2 At 'index.php', you must edit the var '$version'
	2.3 At 'js/constants.js' just change the last declared constant called 'XML' putting the name of the new xml file

3. 'docs' contains the documentation generated by YUIDoc (see: http://yui.github.com/yuidoc/ to check the installation and usage)

4. 'admin' is the website used to let developers and administrators to update properly and comfortably the weights of each method using a table-like application such as Microsoft Excel or any similar program. But, if you want to add more activities/stages or subactivities/substages, you should do it manually editing the xml file directly. This feature could not been implemented by lack of time, but it could be great in the future

5. If you have more doubts, send an email to 'hola@albertoblazquez.net' and I will try to help you, I promise :)
